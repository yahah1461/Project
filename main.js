//---To Note---
//1. All pre-built functions must return a new array
//2. You can make new functions as long as you want but do not change or update the pre-built ones
//3. You can udpdate the values inside the *newsList variable if you want but do not change the variable name
//4. Happy coding :)

//newsList is the variable that holds an array of strings
export var newsList = [
  "What films should an aspiring journalist watch?",
  "Buried underpants and tea bags help scientists evaluate soil",
  "Decoder: Mining asteroids for minerals can help spare Earth",
  "Media glare can enrich tennis pros yet imperil mental health",
  "'Nightmare' TV show 'Euphoria â€” health threat or high art?",
  "Decoder: Armenia in a bind as Ukraine war resets global order",
  "What books should an aspiring journalist read?",
  "Marie Colvin shined a light on war-torn corners of the world",
  "What z"
];

export function search() {

  //inputValue is the variable that contains the search string
  const inputValue = document.getElementById("search-input").value;
  let result = [];
  const searchKo = inputValue.toLocaleLowerCase();
  
  //Code for Search Function
  for (item in newsList){
    if(newsList[item].toString().toLocaleLowerCase().indexOf(searchKo)!=-1){
      result.push(newsList[item])
    }
